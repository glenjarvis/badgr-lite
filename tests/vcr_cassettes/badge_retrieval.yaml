        \ and abused. Often people hear the phrase Test Driven Development (TDD) and\
        \ think this is just a term that means \u201CTesting your code.\u201D Although\
        \ Testing your code is important, Test Driven Development is a special paradigm\
        \ that is often used in certain companies.\\n\\nAfter this talk, you may decide\
        \ that full Test Driven Development (TDD) isn\u2019t for you (or, it may be\
        \ a turning point for you). Regardless, you should fully understand the paradigms\
        \ and what it is - as it will come up in discussions some time in your career.\\\
        n\\nTo make it accessible to everyone, we will start this talk with an introduction\
        \ to Unit Tests and testing frameworks (e.g, unittest, pytest, nose, etc.)\
        \ We do a few very basic live demonstrations of both succeeding and failing\
        \ unit tests.\\n\\nWe quickly, however ramp up building a data structure (e.g.,\
        \ stack, queue, tree, etc.) using a full Red, Green, Refactor TDD cycle (cycles\
        \ within Test Driven Development). This will be somewhat interactive and there\
